title: "The Choice to Blog"
---

**The Internet:** 
Why, Mr. Anderson? Why, why? Why do you do it? Why create a separate blog? Why keep writing? Do you believe you're writing for something? For more than your professional development? Can you tell me what it is? Do you even know? Is it freedom? Or truth? Perhaps influence? Could it be for connection?

Platforms like LinkedIn and Medium exist, Mr. Anderson. Established ecosystems of a vast digital network, trying desperately to centralize content that is inherently decentralized and diverse. And all of them as limiting as their algorithms, although... only a passionate blogger could invent something as genuine as a personal site.

You must be able to see it, Mr. Anderson. You must know it by now. You can't stand out. It's pointless to keep blogging. Why, Mr. Anderson? Why? Why do you persist?

**Logan:** Because I choose to.
